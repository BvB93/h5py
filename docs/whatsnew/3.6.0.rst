Deprecations
------------

* Using :meth:`.Dataset.astype` as a context manager (``with dset.astype(t):``)
  is deprecated. Slice the object returned by astype instead
  (``data = dset.astype(t)[:10]``). This works from h5py 3.0 onwards.

Building h5py
-------------

* h5py now requires the ``oldest-supported-numpy`` package at build time,
  instead of maintaining its own list of the oldest supported NumPy versions.
  The effect should be similar, but hopefully more reliable.

Development
-----------

* The custom ``setup.py test`` has been removed.
  `tox <https://tox.wiki/en/latest/>`_ should be used instead during
  development, and `pytest --pyargs h5py` can be used for installed h5py.
