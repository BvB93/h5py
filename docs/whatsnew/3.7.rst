What's new in h5py 3.6
======================

New features
------------

* Provide the ability to use the Direct Virtual File Driver (VFD) from
  HDF5 (Linux only).
  If the Direct VFD driver is present at the time of compilation, users can use the
  Direct VFD by passing the keyword argument ``driver="direct"`` to the
  ``h5py.File`` constructor.

  To use the Direct VFD HDF5 and h5py must have both been compiled with
  the Direct VFD Driver enabled. Currently, h5py as released on pypi
  does not include the Direct VFD driver.
  Other packages such as the conda package on conda-forge might include it.
  Alternatively, you can build h5py from source against an HDF5 build
  with the direct driver enabled.
* The ``File`` constructor contains two new parameters ``alignment_threshold``,
  and ``alignment_interval`` controling the data alignment within the HDF5
  file.
* h5py wheels on PyPI now bundle HDF5 version 1.12.2.
* Both Apple Silicon (arm64) and Intel (x86_64) wheels are now provided (:pr:`2065`).

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix a deadlock which was possible when the same dataset was accessed from
  multiple threads (:issue:`2064`).
* New attributes are created directly, instead of via a temporary
  attribute with subsequent renaming. This fixes overwriting
  attributes with ``track_order=True``.
* Fixed issue #1847: fancy indexing with boolean arrays was broken.
* Enable setting of fillvalue for datasets with variable length string dtype
* Closing a file or calling ``get_obj_ids()`` no longer re-enables Python
  garbage collection if it was previously disabled.
