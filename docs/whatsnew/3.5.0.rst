New features
------------

* Datasets are now created without timestamps by default, making it easier to
  create more consistent files. Pass ``track_times=True`` to
  :meth:`.Group.create_dataset` to add timestamps again.
* Added `locking` `File` argument to select HDF5 file locking behavior.
* Enable setting file space page size when creating new HDF5 files. A new named argument ``fs_page_size`` is added to ``File()`` class.
* Enable HDF5 page buffering, a low-level caching feature, that may improve overall I/O performance in some cases. Three new named arguments are added to ``File()`` class: ``page_buf_size``, ``min_meta_keep``, and ``min_raw_keep``.
* Get and reset HDF5 page buffering statistics. Available as the low-level API of the ``FileID`` class.
The built-in ``reversed()`` function now works with the following iterables:
* `GroupID`
* `Group`
* `KeysViewHDF5`
* `ValuesViewHDF5`
* `ItemsViewHDF5`

Exposing HDF5 functions
-----------------------

* `H5Pset_file_locking` and `H5Pget_file_locking` (for HDF5 >= 1.12.1 or 1.10.x >= 1.10.7)
* ``H5Freset_page_buffering_stats``
* ``H5Fget_page_buffering_stats``
* ``H5Pset_file_space_page_size``
* ``H5Pget_file_space_page_size``
* ``H5Pset_page_buffer_size``
* ``H5Pget_page_buffer_size``

Bug fixes
---------

* dataset == array now behaves the same way as array == dataset - the HDF5 dataset is read and NumPy makes a boolean array
