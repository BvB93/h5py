New features
------------

* A new :meth:`Group.build_virtual_dataset` method acting as a context manager
  to assemble virtual datasets.
* If the source and target of a virtual dataset mapping have different numbers
  of points, an error should now be thrown when you make the mapping in the
  :class:`VirtualLayout`, rather than later when writing this into the file.
  This should make it easier to find the source of such errors.
