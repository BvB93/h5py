New features
------------

* Provide the ability to use the Direct Virtual File Driver (VFD) from
  HDF5 (Linux only).
  If the Direct VFD driver is present at the time of compilation, users can use the
  Direct VFD by passing the keyword argument ``driver="direct"`` to the
  ``h5py.File`` constructor.

  To use the Direct VFD users must recompile h5py linking to a version of
  HDF5 that enabled support for the Direct VFD at compile time.
